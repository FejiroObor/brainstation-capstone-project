# BrainStation Capstone Project on Loan Default Prediction
Data Science Portfolio Project

**Problem Statement:**
Can I accurately predict which clients are most likely to default on their loans?

For my final capstone project, I decided to focus on Loan default prediction using machine learning models. The aim of this project was to develop models which can be applied by lenders and related financial institutions to improve their risk management practices. To achieve this, I tested four machine leaarning models on a Lending Club Dataset. The results are summarized in the attached files.
