# BrainStation Capstone Project on Loan Default Prediction

**Problem Statement:**
Can I accurately predict which clients are most likely to default on their loans?

For my final capstone project, I decided to focus on Loan default prediction using machine learning models. The aim of this project was to develop models that can be applied by lenders and related financial institutions to improve their risk management practices. To achieve this, I tested four machine-learning models on a Lending Club Dataset. The results are summarized in the attached files.

This folder contains the final submission for my capstone project. Files include:
- **Data dictionary file**
- **Executive summary report**
- **Final capstone presentation**
- **Notebook 1 - EDA**
  In this notebook, I performed some preliminary exploratory data analysis using visualizations to extract insights from the dataset's distribution.
- **Notebook 2 - Pre-processing and Modelling**
  In this notebook, I further cleaned and pre-processed the Lending Club data. After this, I  tested and optimized four supervised ML models.
